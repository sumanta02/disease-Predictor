<p><h3><u>Brief Overview</u></h3>
The project is a user driven Supervised Machine Learning Model, which allows the user to select the disease they want to predict among Four different diseases stated as follows :-
1.	Heart Disease
2.	Breast Cancer
3.	Parkinson’s Disease
4.	Diabetes
After selecting the desired option from the dropdown, the user will move forward by clicking on the “Enter Information” button. Upon clicking, the user will have a new fresh input window pop-up, which will ask the user to enter the formal parameters essential to predict. To proceed further, the user will click on “Get Results”. A new window with the prediction and prediction accuracy will be shown in a fresh screen.

<h3><u>Working Principle</u></h3>
The entire code is operated from the “main.py” file. The main.py contains all the necessary modules required. Along with the standard modules, there are four user defined modules which are “parkinsonsfunc.py”, “BreastCancerFunc.py”, “DiabetesFunc.py” and “HeartDiseaseFunc.py”. These user defined modules contain the respective codes for the prediction of Parkinson’s Disease, Breast Cancer, Diabetes and Heart Disease. 
Further the main.py file contains the frontend code, responsible for the UI(User Interface). We have chosen Tkinter and Custom Tkinter, which is Python’s Graphics User Interface Module. 

<h3><u>Dataset Used</u></h3>
The datasets have been abstracted from Kaggle.com and ScikitLearn In-Built Dataset. All the datasets are pre-cleaned and pre-processed. They only have been fed into the Supervised Machine Leaning Models to train them.

<h3><u>Machine Learning Models Implemented</u></h3>
The following Supervised Machine Learning Models are incorporated :-
1.	Gradient Boosting Classifier
2.	Support Vector Classifier
3.	K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
4.	Logistic Regression
